\section{Execution behaviour}

Kearns et. al. \cite{nevmyvaka2005electronic} determine which limit order price results in the most advantageous execution price.
An approach is presented on how to measure the \textit{return} of an execution.

Risk is being defined as the standard deviation the returns.
