Financial institutions make decisions on whether to buy or sell assets based on various reasons and the high-level trading strategies oftentimes define the purpose of their business.
Regardless of their trading strategy, the invariable outcome is the decision to buy or sell assets.

This work aims to make a step towards answering the non-trivial question on how to optimize a buy or sell of an asset on a stock exchange with the use of reinforcement learning techniques.
Particularly:

    How should one design a reinforcement learning environment and construct features, which are derived from a limit order book, in order to optimize on the non-trivial problem of limit order placement, and what are the limitations thereof?
\end{quote}
We study the data from a cryptocurrency exchange of our choice and build a framework that allows to simulate and understand the outcome of order placement in this market.
We then try to overcome the exploitation of other participants in the market by building an intelligent trader that follows a placement strategy which aims to execute orders to a favourable price.
Multiple reinforcement learning approaches are developed that consider various types of features, which were derived from the financial data set.
To investigate the performance and analyze the behaviour of these approaches we further develop reinforcement learning environments on top of the aforementioned framework which simulate the processes: \textit{order placement} and \textit{market making}.

Our findings show...
